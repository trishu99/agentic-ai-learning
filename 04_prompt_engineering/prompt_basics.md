## Prompt Engineering

Zero-shot: no examples
Few-shot: examples improve accuracy
CoT helps reasoning
Role prompting defines behavior
Structured JSON is mandatory for agents

Prompts are programs

Prompt engineering = programming with natural language

Agents are mostly prompts + logic + tools

## Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot Prompting

Zero-Shot Prompting
with no examples 

Few-Shot Prompting
with few examples


Simple task	--> Zero-shot
New task	--> Few-shot
Consistency needed -->	Few-shot
Agent workflows	--> Usually Few-shot


## Chain-of-Thought

Think step by step -> complex reasoning tasks


## Role Prompting
You tell the model who it is.

Agents = role + rules + tools + memory

## Structured Outputs (JSON / Schemas)

Agents:
talk to code
call APIs
take actions

So output must be structured.
