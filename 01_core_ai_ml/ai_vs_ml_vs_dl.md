AI - Making computers act like smart human
ML - Learn from examples instead of rule 
DL - ML that uses brain like style to learn complex things

## 🤖 Artificial Intelligence (AI)
  Any machine that behaves like it’s “smart”

Examples:
- Chess-playing computer
- Face unlock
- ChatGPT
- Spam filter


## 📊 Machine Learning (ML)
    A way to achieve AI by learning from data

➡️ ML = learning patterns from data

## 🧠 Deep Learning (DL)
    A special type of ML using neural networks with many layers

Used when:
- Data is big
- Patterns are complex

Examples:
- Image recognition
- Speech
- LLMs


## 🧠 Why this matters for Agentic AI
Agents:
- Use DL models (LLMs)
- But rely on ML concepts (classification, confidence, thresholds)
- And are part of a larger AI system
